## üö® Control chart
Control chart plots and processes the input and output data over a period and connects the data points by a line in order to detect trends or unusual wents
### Characteristics
- They are similar to run or trend charts, with an addition of a control limit, line and an average or center line
- Control charts are used with discrete or continuous data
- Control limits (UCL & LCL) are typically set at approximately three standard deviations from the center line
- Specification limits (USL & LSL) normally do not appear on them
- Distribution of the process follows a normal distribution and for many processes the central limit thrown will be applied

Control charts are used when:
- Tracking Process Statistics over time
- Detecting the presence of special causes

Process is in control when:
- Most of the points fall within the bounds of the control limits
- Points do not display any non-random patterns
- Since the data is depicted visually in a control chart, it is easy to find the difference between common cause and special cause

### Setting the Control limits

- The probability of the out-of-control point when the process has not changed is 0.27%
- 99.73% of the data lies within three standard deviations from the mean
- If there is an increase in the point more than 2œÉ; the chance of type 1 or alpha error is high
- If there is an increase in the point more than 4œÉ; the chance of type 2 or beta error is high

Walter Shewart had set 3œÉ limits on control charst with the beliec that when the process goes beyond these limits, it needs correction

### Common rules for control chart analysis
An Out-Of-Control (OOC) condition is indicated if one of the following is true:
1. 1 point is outside the control limit (above UCL/below LCL)
-          p(f) = 0.27%
2. 8 consecutive points are able CL or consecutively below the CL
-          p(f) = (0.5)‚Å∏ = 0.39%
3. 6 to 8 points are consecutively increasing or decreasing
-          p(f) = (0.5)‚Å∂*(0.5)‚Å∏
