## üö® Control chart
Control chart plots and processes the input and output data over a period and connects the data points by a line in order to detect trends or unusual wents
### Characteristics
- They are similar to run or trend charts, with an addition of a control limit, line and an average or center line
- Control charts are used with discrete or continuous data
- Control limits (UCL & LCL) are typically set at approximately three standard deviations from the center line
- Specification limits (USL & LSL) normally do not appear on them
- Distribution of the process follows a normal distribution and for many processes the central limit thrown will be applied

Control charts are used when:
- Tracking Process Statistics over time
- Detecting the presence of special causes

Process is in control when:
- Most of the points fall within the bounds of the control limits
- Points do not display any non-random patterns
- Since the data is depicted visually in a control chart, it is easy to find the difference between common cause and special cause

### Setting the Control limits
